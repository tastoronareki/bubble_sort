# Bubble Sort on Verilog HDL

Combinational logic only, parameterized hardware description, realizing **bubble sort** algorithm.

Also the project is dedicated to **generate** loop verilog constructs study.

You can load Quartus 18.1 project or run testbenches using Modelsim TCL scripts.

Bundled perl script was written to have a side look on the bubble sort algorithm. And having some prictice. That's why it has some redundancy.
